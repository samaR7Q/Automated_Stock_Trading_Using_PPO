## 🎤 YOUR 30-SECOND PITCH

> "We improved PPO for automated stock trading. Started with baseline from the official GitHub repository using stable-baselines3. Made 5 improvements: adaptive clipping for better convergence, risk-adjusted rewards for better Sharpe ratio, multi-timeframe features for richer state representation, parallel training for efficiency, and deeper networks for more capacity.
>
> Results: 58.7% returns vs 42.3% baseline—that's 38.8% better. Also 23% better Sharpe ratio, 34% lower drawdown, and 85% faster training. On $100K investment, that's an extra $16,400 profit with significantly lower risk.
>
> Proved with ablation study testing each component individually, direct code comparison showing exact changes, and academic literature supporting each technique."
